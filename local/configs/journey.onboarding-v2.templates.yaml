      Hello {{.nome_cliente}}! We noticed you didn't complete your registration. Can we help with something?

      Complete your registration now to continue. Click here: {{.metadata.link}}

      We're almost there, {{.nome_cliente}}. Just upload your documents to proceed.

# Variable Interpolation:
# - Direct access: {{nome_cliente}}
# - Dot notation: {{metadata.nome_cliente}}
# - Both work! Metadata comes from JourneyState.Metadata
#
# Example metadata:
# {
#   "nome_cliente": "João Silva",
#   "link": "https://example.com/upload"
# }
